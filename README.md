# nosql-challenge
Part 3 of this challenge was very hard for me. Converting to decimal for some reason wouldnt work correctly in part 3. I also ran out of time as my computer broke over the weekend and couldnt get anyone to fix it until today so I have been trying to finish it and I even had 4 different people try and help me from AskBC and they couldnt figure it out either as to why my code wouldnt work. I got over trying to figure it out so I have submited it even though the last part of part 3 doesnt work very well it was getting irritating trying to work on it. Thanks for letting me have the extension to submit.
